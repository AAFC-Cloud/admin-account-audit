## Description

**Admin Account Audit** is a Rust CLI tool to audit Azure role assignments and group ownerships, focusing on identifying non-admin users who have been granted elevated permissions or own security groups. The tool fetches all role assignments, users, and groups, and outputs a JSON report listing non-admin users with direct or group-based role assignments, as well as non-admin group owners.

- Designed for Azure environments
- Outputs results as a JSON file
- Helps organizations identify potential privilege escalations
